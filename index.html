            <header>What is HTML ?</header>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
                pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
                connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a
                paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                alt="the componets of an elements: content of the element between an opening and a closing tag">
            <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph),
                    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or
                    starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
                </li>
                <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                    before
                    the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common
                    beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
            <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
            <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat
                is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to
                have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
            <code> &lt;p&gt; My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>The <strong>have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another</strong>. With
                the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing
                can result in unexpected results.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes.Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't
                appear in the content. In this example, the <strong>class</strong> attribute is an identifying name used
                to target the element with style information. </p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                alt="attribute added inside the opening tag">
            <p>An attribute should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the
                    attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
            <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements
                combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
            <code>
                <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;html&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;head&gt;<br>
                <code> &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;/head&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;body&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;/body&gt;<br>
                <code>&lt;/html&gt;<br>
                </code>
            <p>Here we have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;:
                </code> The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as
                    links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.
                </li>
                <li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;:</code> The &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all
                    the content on the page.
                    It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;:</code> The &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a
                    container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will
                    show
                    to viewers. </li>
                <li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;:</code> The &lt;meta&gt; element. This element
                    represents metadata that cannot
                    be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like &lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;,
                    &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;:</code> The &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of
                    the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. </li>
                <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;:</code> The &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the
                    content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or
                    whatever else.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
            <header>HTML comments</header>
            <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments
                invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain
                your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough
                that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making
                changes and updates.
                To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>.
                For example:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;I'm not inside a comment&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                &lt;!--&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;--&gt;
                    </code>
